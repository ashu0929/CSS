    <h3> What is CSS?</h3>
    <div class="pra">
        <h4>1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</h4>
        <h4>2. CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</h4>
        <h4>3. <span class="tex1">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="span">CSS saves a lot of work</span> .It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</h4>
        <h4>4. <u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></h4>
    </div>

    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <div class="pra2">
        <h4>:Inline - by using the style sttribute inside HTML elements |</h4>
        <h4>:Internal - by using a style element in the head section </h4>
        <h4>:External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file. </h4>
        <h4>:The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="span">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style</span>,because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself. </h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class="pra3">
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique elements.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <p>In CSS,selectors sre used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element</p>
        
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
